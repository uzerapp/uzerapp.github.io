Product Name: UZER

Description: 

The app “Uzer” allows homeowners, renters, landlords and regular people to share their wireless/data network and provide Internet access to numerous paying customers. 

Through Uzer, the owner of the router will share their wireless network connection in return for money. The owner can set up parameters for the user such as the length of use or the amount of data allowed for use. 

This provides the owners with an opportunity to cut back on their monthly wireless/data costs by putting the money earned through Uzer towards their Internet bills. Router owners looking for extra income can earn money easier than ever before.

It's a win-win situation for both app users (users & providers). One who will get Wifi access all across the world for subtantially lower prices than paying for data, and another will earn extra income for providing Wifi to others. Uzer will also encourage more router owners to switch to high speed and unlimited Internet/data in order to keep up with the demand of users, which will in turn increase sales for telecommunication and wireless company providers. 

Additional features such as a cutting-edge rating system will be implemented in order to give the best possible feedback to owners about their Internet usage and state, and also indicate to users which providers offer the strongest and fastest possible connection. 

The vision of this application is a rich global network of shared wireless Internet that connects with everyone, anywhere. With Uzer, people who travel abroad will no longer have to pay ridiculously expensive roaming fees to use Internet. 

Internet access is a human right. Uzer will take cities one step ahead towards this goal.

* Side note project: The app could have another function which would be wireless telecommunication sharing as well. It consists of allowing users who cannot make long-distance calls, countrywide calls or simply local calls to connect with someone who can through our app or (if they don’t have a smartphone: online through our product’s website) and take ONLY control of the built-in calling app of the provider’s smartphone for a specific amount of time in exchange for money for that specific amount of time used.
