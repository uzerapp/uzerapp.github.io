			    <p>It's totally free when the Internet speed is less than 40 Mpbs! It can't get over 10$/month if you use unlimited Internet speed at over 40 Mpbs! It's simply the best financial decision you can ever make in your lifetime. Hands-down.</p>

			    <h3>Providers' typical plan.</h3>

			    <p>Typical network providers normally overcharge people for faster network speed (Mpbs) and those expensive roaming fees can get over 140$ a month. It's over 15% more than what we would make you pay for Unlimited Wifi speed > 40 Mpbs</p>
